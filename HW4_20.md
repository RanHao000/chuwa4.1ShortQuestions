### 1. What is IOC?
    
    IoC is a design principle which recommends the inversion of different kinds of controls in object-oriented design to achieve loose coupling between application classes. In this case, control refers to any additional responsibilities a class has, other than its main responsibility, such as control over the flow of an application, or control over the dependent object creation and binding (Remember SRP - Single Responsibility Principle). If you want to do TDD (Test Driven Development), then you must use the IoC principle, without which TDD is not possible. 
    
### 2. What is DI?
    
    Dependency injection (DI) is the concept in which objects get other required objects from outside. DI can be implemented in any programming language. The general concept behind dependency injection is called Inversion of Control.
    
### 3. how many DI injections in Spring Boot? please also give me code example.(只给你能展示这几种方法的例子就行，不用写完整的代码)
    
    1) **Setter Dependency Injection (SDI)**: This is the simpler of the two DI methods. In this, the DI will be injected with the help of setter and/or getter methods. Now to set the DI as SDI in the bean, it is done through the **bean-configuration file.** For this, the property to be set with the SDI is declared under the **<property>** tag in the bean-config file.
    
    ```java
    @Bean
    public Store store() {
        Store store = new Store();
        store.setItem(item1());
        return store;
    }
    ```
    
    2) **Constructor Dependency Injection (CDI)**: In this, the DI will be injected with the help of
    
    **[constructors](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/constructors-in-java/)**. Now to set the DI as CDI in bean, it is done through the **bean-configuration file.** For this, the property to be set with the CDI is declared under the **<constructor-arg>**
    
    tag in the bean-config file.
    
    ```java
    @Configuration
    public class AppConfig {
    
        @Bean
        public Item item1() {
            return new ItemImpl1();
        }
    
        @Bean
        public Store store() {
            return new Store(item1());
        }
    }
    ```
    
    3) ****Field-Based Dependency Injection****
    
    ```java
    public class Store {
        @Autowired
        private Item item; 
    }
    ```
    
### 4. Which DI Injection is better way to use?
    
    Constructor inject is better than other options.
    
    In **constructor injection** strategy, container imposes (or must impose) to provide the dependencies properly while constructing the bean. This was addressed as ***" container-agnostic manner"***, as we are required to provide dependencies while creating the bean, thus making the visibility of dependency, independent of any IoC container.
    
### 5. What are HTTP request methods?
    
    GET is used to retrieve and request data from a specified resource in a server. GET is one of the most popular HTTP request techniques. In simple words, the GET method is used to retrieve whatever information is identified by the Request-URL.
    
### 6. What are differences between POST and PUT?
    - PUT method is called when you have to modify a single resource while POST method is called when you have to add a child resource.
    - PUT method response can be cached but you cannot cache POST method responses.
    - You can use UPDATE query in PUT whereas you can use create query in POST.
    - In PUT method, the client decides which URI resource should have, and in POST method, the server decides which URI resource should have.
    - PUT works as specific while POST work as abstract.
    - If you send the same PUT request multiple times, the result will remain the same but if you send the same POST request multiple times, you will receive different results.
    - PUT method is idempotent whereas POST method is not idempotent.
### 7. What is URL and What is URI?
    
    A URI or **Uniform Resource Identifier** is a string identifier that refers to a resource on the internet. It is a string of characters that is used to identify any resource on the [internet](https://www.javatpoint.com/internet) using location, name, or both. A URI has two subsets; **[URL (Uniform Resource Locator)](https://www.javatpoint.com/url-full-form)** and **URN (Uniform Resource Number)**. If it contains only a name, it means it is not a URL. Instead of directly URI, we mostly see the URL and URN in the real world.
    
    A URL or **Uniform Resource Locator** is used to find the location of the resource on the web. It is a reference for a resource and a way to access that resource. A URL always shows a unique resource, and it can be an HTML page, a CSS document, an image, etc.
    
    A URL uses a protocol for accessing the resource, which can be HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.
    
    It is mainly referred to as the address of the website, which a user can find in their address bars.
    
    read this article **again and again and again PLEASE** ([https://danielmiessler.com/study/difference-between-uri-url/](https://danielmiessler.com/study/difference-between-uri-url/))
    
### 8. What is path variable? and what is Request Parameter?
    
    `@RequestParam` is used to extract *query parameters*
    
    `@PathVariable` is used to extract data right from the URI
    
    `@RequestParam`is more useful on a traditional web application where data is mostly passed in the query parameters while `@PathVariable`is more suitable for RESTful web services where URL contains values.
    
### 9. What are HTTP Response Status Codes?
    
    HTTP response status codes (or simply status codes) are three-digit codes issued by a server in response to a browser-side request from a client. These status codes serve as a means of quick and concise communication on how the server worked on and responded to the client’s request. HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)
     request has been successfully completed.
