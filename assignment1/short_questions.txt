1. What is the basic steps to init a git repo in your local?
The 1st step is to create a directory and cd to it;
The 2nd step is to run “git init”.

2. How to clone a repo from Github?
The 1st step is to copy the link of the repo from Github;
The 2nd step is to run “git clone link”.

3. How to create a new branch and checkout to that branch?
Let’s say the name of branch is dev.
The 1st way is to run “git checkout -b dev”;
The 2nd way is to run “git branch dev; git checkout dev”.

4. How to merge the new-branch to master branch? show me the commands
Let’s say the new-branch is dev.
git checkout master;
git merge dev;

5. What is maven role? what it be used to do?
Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

6. What is the lifecycle of maven? could you tell me the details?
Lifecycle of maven is a series of phase. There are 3 lifecycles: Default, Clean and Site.
Default maven lifecycle has 8 phases: Validate, Compile, Test, Package, Integration Test, Verify, Install and Deploy.
Clean maven lifecycle has 3 phases: pre-clean, clean, post-clean.

7. What is the difference between package and install in maven lifecycle?
Package: This step packages the compiled code in distributable format like JAR or WAR.
Install: This step installs the packaged code to the local Maven repository.
Deploy: It copies the packaged code to the remote repository for sharing it with other developers.

8. What is difference between passing by value and passing by reference? Could you design a code to verify your understanding and screenshot it to me?
The main difference between pass by value and pass by reference is that, in a pass by value, the parameter value copies to another variable while, in a pass by reference, the actual parameter passes to the function.

import java.util.*;

public class PassValueOrReference {
    public final static void main(String[] args) {
        PassValueOrReference solution = new PassValueOrReference();

        int num_int = 4;
        System.out.println(String.format("Before running passing_value, num_int == %d", num_int));
        solution.passing_value(num_int);
        System.out.println(String.format("After running passing_value, num_int == %d", num_int));

        List<Integer> num_list = new ArrayList();
        num_list.add(1);
        num_list.add(2);
        System.out.println("Before running passing_reference, num_list == " + num_list);
        solution.passing_reference(num_list);
        System.out.println("After running passing_reference, num_list == " + num_list);
    }

    private void passing_value(int num) {
        ++num;
        System.out.println(String.format("In function passing_value: %d", num));
    }

    private void passing_reference(List<Integer> nums) {
        nums.add(3);
        System.out.println("In function passing_reference: " + nums);
    }
}

9. practice git and github then provide one screenshot to prove you have done it.

10. create a maven project using Intellij like the teacher did in the class, send screenshot to me.
